            <h2>What is APM</h2>
            <p>
              Application Performance Monitoring/Management is a solution for
              <i>capturing</i> and <i>measuring</i> performance metrics.
            </p>
            <p>
              While seemingly almost identical, these terms mean—and can lead
              to—two different things.

            <h2>Application Performance Monitoring</h2>
            <p>
              falls under the management category. It plays a critical role as
              it points out that there is a problem within your application and
              provides a reactive approach.
            </p>

            <h2>Application Performance Management</h2>
            <p>
              it has a broader scope of strategies in managing the app’s overall
              performance. It is a more proactive approach to performance
              engineering.

            <aside class="notes">
              For example, monitoring solutions will alert you when your Python
              app has memory spikes. However, management solutions take it a
              step further. It will help you mitigate issues, starting with code
              application dependencies, memory trends, and user experience. It
              means monitoring informs that users encountered problems.
              Management helps find the root cause of why these problems
              occurred. As a result, the latter provides a complete strategy
              ensuring full visibility into the app performance.

            <h2>Collecting data - Logging (I)</h2>
            <h3>Log everything!</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Major branching points in your code</li>
              <li>When errors or unexpected values are encountered</li>
              <li>Any I/O or resource intensive operations</li>
              <li>Significant domain events</li>

            <h2>Collecting data - Logging (II)</h2>
            <h3>Use Log Levels appropriately</h3>
            <p>
              Every logging frameworks associate by default a logging level to
              each message. <strong>Debug</strong> and
              <strong>Info</strong> show debug information and contextual
              information that’s helpful to understand the current flow.
              <strong>Warn</strong> indicates something is probably wrong.
              <strong>Error</strong> indicates an error has occurred. Usually,
              we’ll want to log <strong>Error</strong> messages when we catch
              exceptions. <strong>Fatal</strong> usually means a major error has
              occurred that requires to terminate Bthe application.
            </p>

            <h2>Collecting data - Logging (III)</h2>
            <h3>Enable only high-severity logs in Production</h3>
            <p>
              As a rule of thumb, we don’t want to enable Debug and Info levels
              in production. We want to log just Warn messages and above or just
              Error and above.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Collecting data - Logging (IV)</h2>
            <h3>Log Exceptions</h3>
            <p>
              For production debugging, logging Exceptions is crucial. It’s
              usually the most important piece of information we need to solve
              the bug
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Collecting data - Logging (V)</h2>
            <h3>Log Context</h3>
            <p>
              To understand production problems, we need context. While the
              Exception is the most important thing, the Context is the 2nd most
              important. We need to know the Http Request, current thread,
              current machine, state, user information, etc.

              Kubernetes is the leading orchestration platform for containerized
              applications.

            <h2>Health checks</h2>
            <p>
              To manage containers effectively, Kubernetes needs a way to check
              their health to see if they are working correctly and receiving
              traffic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kubernetes uses health checks—also known as probes—to determine if
              instances of your app are running and responsive.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Types of probes</h2>
            <dl>
              <dt>Liveness probes</dt>
              <dd>allow Kubernetes to check if your app is alive</dd>

              <dt>Readiness probes</dt>
              <dd>
                Kubernetes uses this probe to know when the container is ready
                to start accepting traffic.
              </dd>

              <dt>Startup probes</dt>
              <dd>
                are used to determine when a container application has been
                initialized successfully

            <h2>Creating Probes</h2>
            <p>
              To create health check probes, you must issue requests against a
              container. There are three ways of implementing Kubernetes
              liveness, readiness, and startup probes:
